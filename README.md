In this study, our team sought to understand the relationship between foreign language advertising in wine retail and consumer willingness to pay/price perception. The high variance of wine prices, along with the strong association between place of origin and the signal on quality made it a great subject for our field experiment. We designed, launched, and analyzed the results of a multifactorial design that toggled three treatment variables of interest: advertising language, wineâ€™s country of origin, and length of flavor profile description.

- Advertising Language: English, French
- Wine's Country of Origin: USA, France, Germany
- Length of Flavor Profile Description: Long, Short

This equates to a 3 x 2 x 2 factorial design (ie. 12 unique treatment conditions).
