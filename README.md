In this study, our team sought to understand the relationship between foreign language advertising in wine retail and consumer willingness to pay/price perception. The high variance of wine prices, along with the strong association between place of origin and the signal on quality made it a great subject for our field experiment. We designed, launched, and analyzed the results of a multifactorial design that toggled three treatment variables of interest: advertising language, wineâ€™s country of origin, and length of flavor profile description.

- Advertising Language: English, French
- Wine's Country of Origin: USA, France, Germany
- Length of Flavor Profile Description: Long, Short

This equates to a 3 x 2 x 2 factorial design (ie. 12 unique treatment conditions).

We conducted the experiment through a Qualtrics survey, and gathered responses via Mechanical Turk. For the survey, participants first answer demographic questions, then were prompted with the treatment. The multiple treatments were administered simultaneously in the form of an image of an online marketing page.
